       "A retired professor has returned to his estate to live with his beautiful young wife, Yelena. The estate originally belonged to his first wife, now deceased; her mother and brother still live there and manage the farm. For many years the brother (Uncle Vanya) has sent the farm's proceeds to the professor, while receiving only a small salary himself. Sonya, the professor's daughter, who is about the same age as his new wife, also lives on the estate. The professor is pompous, vain, and irritable. He calls the doctor (Astrov) to treat his gout, only to send him away without seeing him. Astrov is an experienced physician who performs his job conscientiously, but has lost all idealism and spends much of his time drinking. The presence of Yelena introduces a bit of sexual tension into the household. Astrov and Uncle Vanya both fall in love with Yelena; she spurns them both. Meanwhile, Sonya is in love with Astrov, who fails even to notice her. Finally, when the professor announces he wants to sell the estate, Vanya, whose admiration for the man died with his sister, tries to kill him.                                                                11\n",
       "Olga, Masha, and Irina Prozoroff lead lonely and purposeless lives following the death of their father who has commanded the local army post. Olga attempts to find satisfaction in teaching but secretly longs for a home and family. Masha, unhappy with her marriage to a timid schoolmaster, falls hopelessly in love with a married colonel. Irina works in the local telegraph office but longs for gaiety. Their sense of futility is increased by their brother's marriage to Natasha, a coarse peasant girl. She gradually encroaches on the family home until even the private refuge of the sisters is destroyed. They dream of starting a new life in Moscow but are saddled with the practicalities of their quiet existence. Despite their past failures, they resolve to seek some purpose and hope when the army post is withdrawn from the town.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        8\n",

       "There is a building called \"SuoMeng Lou\". It is said this building is built for connubial love. The Jiangs do silk business for generations. However, till the early Republic of China, only a widow is left in the family of Jiang, sticking to traditional standards and managing Jiang's family business. As society changes, a Shanghai dancing girl comes to the Jiangs. She is pregnant and wants to marry the eldest son of the Jiangs. Moreover, the second son of the Jiangs, who is far-sighted and wise, is willing to marry a poor girl who does not want to become a member of the Jiangs. In that traditional society, the three women's conflict is inevitable. The dancing girl wants to be a member of the Jiangs, but she is disapproved by Jiangs. So she finds her ways to challenge the dignity of the Jiangs. While that poor girl, who has married herself into the family, challenges the rigid system and traditions from inside. Besides, the conservative widow tries her best to defend traditional standards in the Jiangs. Finally, Jin Feng and Zhou Qing make a great difference on the Jiangs. \"SuoMeng Lou\" opens again, which becomes a new start for the Jiangs.     2\n",
